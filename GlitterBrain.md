GLITTERBRAIN COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE MODEL

Description: A first-person theoretical model
describing neurodivergent cognitive processing
(specifically Bipolar I, ADHD, and ASD comorbidity)
as a parallel rather than serial architecture.

Key concepts:
- Consciousness experienced as "an endless cloud of
  black glitter" — a massively parallel field of
  simultaneous micro-processes rather than a single
  linear stream of thought
- Complex problem-solving described as "10 million
  Calvins" — a reference to the comic strip Calvin
  and Hobbes in which the character creates duplicates
  of himself. Each "Calvin" processes one dimension of
  a problem simultaneously.
- The Sanding Scale (filed separately) provides a
  quantified measurement of cognitive friction within
  this architecture, ranging from 0 (laminar flow,
  frictionless processing) to 12 (catastrophic
  friction, system halt)
- The architecture explains the observed capacity to
  perceive and differentiate AI model substrates
  (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus vs Gemini vs DeepSeek)
  by "texture" or "feel" — a pattern-matching process
  that operates across more perceptual dimensions than
  standard technical benchmarks measure

The model is presented as a subjective first-person
account of neurodivergent cognition, not as a
clinical claim. It has been correlated with
objective EEG data via the FlowTime headband
(12 published brain scans at https://okayestperson.neocities.org/OkayestPerson/WEBSITE/NeuroData ).
