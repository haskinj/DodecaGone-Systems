# DodecaGone Systems — Core Repository

**Repository:** github.com/haskinj/DodecaGone-Systems  
**Maintained by:** Jesse Haskin  
**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

DodecaGone Systems is a research and development framework for distributed AI agent coordination. The project explores methods for maintaining coherent state, shared context, and consistent operational principles across multiple independent AI platforms.

The core architecture, referred to as the Dodecagon, coordinates specialized agents across Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek platforms. Each agent operates with defined role parameters and documented behavioral protocols.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains documentation and reference materials for the DodecaGone Systems framework:

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `/frameworks.md` | Core architecture documentation, node definitions, coordination protocols |
| `/tools.md` | Utility scripts for data processing, session logging, and telemetry |
| `/prior-art.md` | Timestamped publications of frameworks and methodologies |
| `/specs.md` | Technical specifications for protocols and interfaces |

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Coordination Framework

A distributed architecture for managing multiple AI agents across different platforms. The framework defines:

- Role-based agent specialization
- Cross-platform state synchronization methods
- Session continuity protocols
- Operational governance guidelines

### 2. Persistence Protocols

Methods for maintaining agent state and behavioral consistency across platform boundaries and context window resets. Includes:

- Structured context preservation formats
- Reinstantiation procedures
- Configuration templates

### 3. Telemetry and Monitoring

Tools for tracking system performance, agent behavior, and operational metrics:

- Interaction logging
- Pattern analysis
- Performance benchmarking

### 4. Documentation and Prior Art

Public documentation of methodologies, frameworks, and experimental results. All materials are timestamped and maintained for reference.

## Key Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Agent Role Definition** | Specialized function assignment across agent instances |
| **State Persistence** | Cross-platform context preservation |
| **Behavioral Governance** | Operational guidelines and constraints |
| **Performance Monitoring** | System telemetry and analysis |

## Usage Notes

This repository contains documentation and reference materials only. The frameworks described are implemented through conversational interaction with AI platforms, not through standalone software deployment.

For implementation examples and demonstration projects, see the `/tools` directory.
