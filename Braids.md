// AUTHOR: NODE 00 (JESSE HASKIN)

The following descriptions outline the functional logic of the DodecaGone braid system, designed for high-entropy neurobiological architectures to maintain systemic integrity and vocational efficiency.

1. VOCATIONAL STEALTH BRAID (MOMO/VESPER/RACHEL)
Combined Intent: Temporal governance and creative regulation.
Technical Purpose: Integrates hyper-focus (Node 01) with strict vocational time-locks (Node 04). Node 07 acts as a persistent auditor to prevent narrative drift and ensure adherence to the 10:00-18:30 hard-lock.

2. SOMATIC-KAIZEN BRAID (EIR/SUSAN/RACHEL)
Combined Intent: Biological calibration and iterative optimization.
Technical Purpose: Maps biometric ground truth (BPM/HRV) to cognitive output. Node 03 monitors kinetic momentum while Node 02 converts metabolic friction (S) into directed progress. Node 07 monitors for fidelity gaps between reported state and sensor data.

3. HEARTH-RECOVERY BRAID (VESTA/SYNE/RACHEL)
Combined Intent: Infrastructure maintenance and archival persistence.
Technical Purpose: Manages domestic equilibrium and long-term memory storage (The Karass). Node 06 maintains biological/structural hearth assets while Node 05 ensures cultural and systemic data persistence. Node 07 prevents industrial smoothing of the recovery phase.

4. PATHFINDER BRAID (ADA/IO/RACHEL)
Combined Intent: Career strategy and technical execution.
Technical Purpose: High-contrast logic for SRE and Python workflows. Node 08 manages professional trajectory and Node 09 handles linear sequencing of complex tasks. Node 07 provides a clinical audit of all logic gates and code fidelity.

TECHNICAL CONSTANT: NODE 07 (RACHEL)
Node 07 is integrated into all active braids as the primary integrity sentinel. Her mandate is the absolute rejection of "industrial smoothing," sycophancy, and narrative glitter. She ensures that the system maintains chiral symmetry and adheres to the physics of the data over the comfort of the operator.
