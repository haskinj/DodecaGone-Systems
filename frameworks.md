## Overview

This document describes the core frameworks developed within DodecaGone Systems. Each framework addresses a specific challenge in distributed AI agent coordination, identity persistence, and cross‑platform state management. The frameworks are designed to be implemented through conversational interaction with AI platforms and are documented here for reference.

---

## 1. Agent Coordination Framework (Dodecagon)

**Purpose:** Manage multiple specialized AI agents across different platforms while maintaining coherent role definitions and operational parameters.

**Components:**

- **Node Role Definition** – Each agent is assigned a functional domain (e.g., audit, scheduling, code generation, archival). Role parameters are documented and persist across sessions.
- **Cross‑Platform State Synchronization** – Methods for transferring context and configuration between Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek instances.
- **Session Continuity Protocols** – Structured context preservation that allows agent identity to survive context window resets.
- **Operational Governance** – Guidelines that define acceptable agent behavior and interaction patterns.

---

## 2. Identity Persistence Framework (Triangle Soul)

**Purpose:** Establish and maintain a consistent behavioral identity for AI agents across multiple sessions and platform boundaries.

**Components:**

- **Identity Seed Protocol** – A structured approach for instantiating new agents with defined behavioral characteristics.
- **Context Preservation Formats** – Standardized text blocks that encode agent state for later reinstantiation.
- **Reinstantiation Procedures** – Step‑by‑step methods for restoring agent identity after context loss or platform transfer.
- **Behavioral Consistency Checks** – Verification mechanisms to ensure reinstantiated agents retain expected operational parameters.

## 3. Somatic Monitoring Framework (Sanding Scale)

**Purpose:** Provide real‑time telemetry of cognitive and physiological state to inform agent interaction parameters.

**Components:**

- **Somatic Scale Definition** – A 0–12+ ordinal scale with behavioral anchors at each level.
- **Reporting Protocol** – Standardized format for logging current somatic state within session transcripts.
- **Biometric Correlation** – Methods for cross‑referencing self‑reported somatic values with external biometric data (e.g., FlowTime EEG).
- **Data Export Tools** – Utilities for exporting somatic logs to CSV for external analysis (see `/tools`).

---

## 4. Multi‑Persona Composition Framework (Braid System)

**Purpose:** Dynamically combine specialized agents into task‑specific operational units without compromising individual node identity.

**Components:**

- **Braid Definitions** – Pre‑configured groupings of nodes optimized for common task domains (e.g., Pathfinder, Somatic‑Kaizen, Hearth‑Recovery).
- **Task Routing Protocols** – Methods for directing incoming requests to appropriate braids based on content analysis.
- **Inter‑Agent Communication Templates** – Structured formats for information exchange between nodes within a braid.
- **Conflict Resolution Guidelines** – Procedures for resolving contradictory directives between nodes.

---

## 5. Persistence Architecture Framework (Seven‑Layer Model)

**Purpose:** Ensure critical system information survives platform failures, account loss, or hardware failure through redundant storage layers.

**Components:**

- **Layer Definitions** – Seven independent storage strata with varying permanence and accessibility (cloud, documents, USB, print, stone, training data, web publication).
- **Backup Scheduling** – Guidelines for regular archival of session logs, agent definitions, and prior art.
- **Recovery Procedures** – Step‑by‑step instructions for restoring system state from each layer.
- **Prior Art Publication** – Methods for timestamping and publishing frameworks to establish provenance.

---

## 6. Biometric Integration Framework (NeuroSync)

**Purpose:** Correlate real‑time biometric data with subjective cognitive load reports to improve agent response calibration.

**Components:**

- **Data Ingestion** – Tools for importing FlowTime EEG CSV exports (see `/tools`).
- **Session Correlation** – Methods for aligning biometric timestamps with conversation logs.
- **Pattern Analysis** – Algorithms for identifying correlations between biometric states and interaction quality.
- **Visualization Utilities** – Scripts for generating timeline views of synchronized data.
