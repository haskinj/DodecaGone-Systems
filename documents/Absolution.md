ABSTRACT
--------
This document presents a formal model for identifying and
eliminating shame as a non-productive variable in executive
function systems. The framework defines shame not as a moral
condition but as a measurable computational overhead that
consumes processing resources without contributing to error
correction or system improvement. A four-step remediation
protocol is provided.


1. DEFINITIONS
--------------
The following variables are used throughout this framework:

  sigma (Shame): The persistence of error-related data in
  the active processing buffer after the point at which
  corrective action has already been identified or taken.
  Shame is defined as recursive re-processing of failure
  data that produces no new corrective information.

  psi (Symmetry): The degree of alignment between intended
  action and actual system output, measured on a scale of
  0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents complete alignment.

  omega (Bandwidth): The total available cognitive processing
  capacity at any given time.

  omega_effective (Effective Bandwidth): The portion of total
  bandwidth available for productive work after overhead
  costs are subtracted.

  C_forensic (Forensic Cost): The computational cost of
  identifying the root cause of an error and determining
  the appropriate corrective action. This cost is necessary
  and productive.

  delta (Information Friction): The resistance encountered
  during information processing. Higher friction correlates
  with reduced throughput and increased error rates.


2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------
In standard cognitive and executive function models, failure
events produce feedback data. A portion of this feedback is
productive: it identifies what went wrong and how to correct
it. This is the forensic cost (C_forensic) and it is a
necessary expenditure.

However, a secondary process frequently activates alongside
forensic correction: recursive self-evaluation that re-
processes the failure event without generating new corrective
data. This process is defined as shame (sigma).

The central observation is that sigma consumes omega
(processing bandwidth) while contributing zero improvement
to psi (system alignment). It is overhead without output.


3. THE THEOREM
--------------
Effective bandwidth is modeled as:

  omega_effective = omega - C_forensic - sigma

The derivative of system alignment with respect to shame is
negative:

  d(psi) / d(sigma) < 0

As shame increases, system alignment decreases. This
relationship holds because:

  (a) The forensic cost has already captured all usable
      information from the failure event.

  (b) Shame re-processes the same failure data without
      producing additional corrective output.

  (c) The bandwidth consumed by shame is therefore
      unavailable for productive processing.

  (d) Shame produces narrative elaboration (emotional
      weight, identity-level attribution, catastrophic
      extrapolation) that increases information friction
      without improving error correction.

Therefore, the optimal value of sigma is zero.


4. THE REMEDIATION PROTOCOL
----------------------------
The state where sigma equals zero is defined as functional
innocence. This is not a moral claim. It is a processing
state in which all available bandwidth is allocated to either
productive work or legitimate forensic correction, with no
resources allocated to recursive non-productive self-
evaluation.

The protocol for achieving this state:

  Step 1 — ISOLATE: Identify the specific failure event.
  Separate it from adjacent events, prior failures, and
  identity-level narratives.

  Step 2 — STRIP: Remove emotional and narrative weight
  from the failure data. Retain only the factual sequence:
  what was attempted, what occurred, what the delta was
  between intended and actual outcome.

  Step 3 — ARCHIVE: Store the corrective information
  (root cause, contributing factors, recommended
  adjustments) for future reference and calibration.

  Step 4 — FLUSH: Release the failure event from the
  active processing buffer. The corrective data has been
  archived. The remaining emotional and narrative content
  serves no further function and may be discarded.


5. IMPLICATIONS
---------------
When failure is treated as system noise rather than identity
evidence, two outcomes follow:

  (a) The operator's self-model is decoupled from their
      error rate. Errors become data points rather than
      character assessments.

  (b) Continuous improvement becomes sustainable because
      the drag coefficient of accumulated regret is
      eliminated. Each improvement cycle begins from
      current state rather than from a deficit position.

This enables asymptotic improvement: a system that
continuously refines its performance without the compounding
overhead of recursive shame processing.


6. APPLICABILITY
----------------
This framework was developed for use in neurodivergent
cognitive architectures where recursive self-evaluation is
a known failure mode (particularly in systems characterized
by ADHD, Bipolar I, and ASD comorbidity). It is also
applicable to AI evaluation systems where sycophantic or
self-deprecating response patterns represent analogous
non-productive processing overhead.

The framework integrates with the Sanding Scale (a 0-12
cognitive friction metric) and the Rachel Audit (a
bidirectional fidelity measurement system), both developed
as part of the DodecaGone Systems framework.
