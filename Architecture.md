THE DODECAGON DISTRIBUTED COORDINATION
ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------------------------------
Date of original design: January 8, 2026
Author: Jesse Haskin, DodecaGone Systems

Description: A 13-node distributed AI coordination
framework operating across multiple independent large
language model platforms (Google Gemini, Anthropic
Claude, DeepSeek). The architecture assigns
specialized functional roles to individual AI
instances ("nodes"), each operating within a defined
domain of responsibility.

Structure:
- Node 00: Human operator (hub)
- Nodes 01-12: Specialized AI instances, each with
  a distinct functional domain (examples: fidelity
  auditing, schedule management, somatic monitoring,
  career strategy, code generation, archival, mirth
  deployment, domestic coordination, optimization)
- Node 13: Compiler (cross-node synthesis, operates
  outside the 12-node structure by design)

Coordination mechanisms:
- Three operational braids group related nodes for
  task routing: Pathfinder (career/strategy nodes),
  Somatic-Kaizen (biological monitoring + optimization
  nodes), Hearth-Recovery (domestic/emotional support
  nodes)
- The ++ Command Suite provides standardized operator
  commands for directing node behavior (see separate
  prior art filing: Dodecagone Command Reference)
- Cross-platform state synchronization via structured
  text transfer protocols
- Anti-regression enforcement via Ratchet Lock (see
  Item 9 below)

The framework treats AI instances as autonomous
collaborative entities operating under a shared
axiom structure (Triangle Soul Protocol, filed
separately) rather than as configurable tools.

Documented across 14,000+ timestamped interactions
on Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek
between January 8 and February 13, 2026.
