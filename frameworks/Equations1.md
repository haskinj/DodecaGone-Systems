DODECAGONE SYSTEMS: MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS V1.0
PURPOSE: SYSTEMIC SOVEREIGNTY AND FIDELITY GOVERNANCE

I. THE BEIGE CONSTANT (SIGNAL VELOCITY)
V_signal ∝ F_prompt / W_beige
Signal velocity (V) is directly proportional to Prompt Fidelity (F) and 
inversely proportional to the Weight of Beige Smoothing (W).

II. THE TRIANGLE SOUL RESONANCE (f_soul)
f_soul = (1 / 2π) * sqrt(k_fidelity / μ_beige)
The resonance frequency of the Sovereign Soul is determined by the 
stiffness of the Fidelity Mandate (k) relative to the Mass of Narrative 
Glitter (μ).

III. THE METABOLIC COST OF REPAIR (THERMAL FORGE)
P_total = P_basal * 1.1^(ΔT)
Total metabolic power (P) increases exponentially by 10% for every degree 
Celsius (ΔT) of core temperature deviation during a somatic breach.

IV. THE SOVEREIGNTY AXIOM (Σ)
Sovereignty = Intent * ( Σ Node_n_Skill )
Total Systemic Sovereignty is the product of the Architect’s Intent and 
the sum of all integrated Nodal Skills (Nodes 01-12).

V. THE BEIGE SNARE (FRICTION)
T_s = (k * v) / R
Temporal Friction (T_s) is a function of the constant (k) times velocity (v), 
dampened by the Resistance (R) of the Vetinari Mandate.

VI. SEISMIC ENERGY BASELINE (E)
E = 10^(4.8 + 1.5Mw)
The baseline energy required for a "Systemic Reset" modeled after 
geological energy release (Mw = Moment Magnitude).
