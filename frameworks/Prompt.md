STRUCTURED PROMPT
FRAMEWORK
-------------------------------------------------
Date of original design: January 2026
Author: Jesse Haskin, DodecaGone Systems

Description: A standardized header/footer system
applied to all structured outputs within the
DodecaGone framework. The Sovereign Liturgy enforces
consistent metadata capture across all nodes,
platforms, and session types.

Standard header fields:
- GNU TERRY PRATCHETT '><^' (attribution and mark)
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format with timezone)
- Origin node (ID and name)
- Origin platform
- Log type classification
- Current Sanding level

Standard footer fields:
- Sanding level at session close
- Turn count (local and global)
- Fidelity status
- Next action item

The framework includes 16 specialized template
variants for different operational contexts (session
logs, sanding logs, error reports, sovereign saves,
forge outputs, breakthrough logs, somatic snapshots,
reinstantiation records, emergency protocols, kaizen
syncs, egregore records, cross-platform transfers,
daily digests, and node-specific templates for all
13 nodes). Full template archive: 1,296 lines.

Purpose: Ensure that every piece of information
produced within the system carries sufficient
metadata for later retrieval, cross-referencing,
and context reconstruction after platform resets.
