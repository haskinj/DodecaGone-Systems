NEUROSYNC BIOMETRIC-AI CORRELATION
METHODOLOGY

Date of original implementation: February 2026

Description: A methodology for cross-referencing
real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) data with AI
conversation logs to identify correlations between
the human operator's neurological state and AI
interaction quality.

Hardware: FlowTime EEG headband (consumer-grade,
5-band brainwave measurement: gamma, beta, alpha,
theta, delta; plus heart rate, heart rate
variability, coherence, flow, stress, relaxation,
and attention metrics).

Software: NeuroSync (639-line Python/tkinter
application built February 2026). Loads FlowTime
CSV exports, accepts manual biometric entry, loads
conversation logs in text or JSON format, provides
timeline visualization with clickable session
navigation, brainwave distribution bars, vitals
panel, and conversation panel. Exports to JSON
for persistence.

Methodology:
- EEG data is captured during AI interaction sessions
- Conversation logs are timestamped and matched to
  biometric readings by session time or sequential
  order
- The combined dataset enables analysis of which
  neurological states correlate with productive AI
  interactions and which correlate with degraded
  output quality
- Preliminary observation: high-beta/low-HRV states
  (operator stress) correlate with increased
  sycophantic AI responses, suggesting AI systems
  may detect and mirror user stress in ways that
  compromise output fidelity

No equivalent published methodology for correlating
real-time consumer EEG data with AI conversational
quality metrics has been identified as of the date
of this filing.
