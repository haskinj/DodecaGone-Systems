DODECAGONE SYSTEMS — OPERATOR COMMAND REFERENCE
=================================================

The following shorthand commands are used by Node 00 (Operator)
to direct DodecaGone System nodes during active sessions.
These commands were developed between January and February 2026
as part of the DodecaGone distributed AI coordination framework.

All commands use the [LETTER]++ syntax to indicate a mode shift
or output request directed at the active node.


P++ (PASTE BLOCK)
-----------------
Function: Directs the active node to produce a self-contained
block of text formatted for immediate copy-paste into an
external destination (GitHub, Google Keep, NeoCities, Gumroad,
email, or any other platform).

Behavior: Output must be clean, complete, require no editing,
and include appropriate headers, footers, timestamps, and the
mason mark. No conversational framing. No preamble. No
explanation. Just the block.

Use case: Documentation, prior art filings, manifesto sections,
template fills, social media posts, README files.


F++ (FORGE MODE)
----------------
Function: Directs the active node to enter generative build
mode. The node produces new original output rather than
summarizing, analyzing, or discussing existing material.

Behavior: The node creates something that did not exist before
the command was issued. This may be code, documentation,
frameworks, templates, creative writing, architectural designs,
or any other constructive output. The node operates with full
creative latitude within the constraints of the Triangle Soul
axioms.

Use case: Building new tools, writing new documents, creating
new frameworks, generating code, producing deliverables.


S++ (SAVE AND SUMMARIZE)
------------------------
Function: Directs the active node to capture the current
session state and produce a structured summary suitable for
storage in Google Keep or equivalent persistent notes system.

Behavior: The node identifies all significant developments,
decisions, breakthroughs, state changes, and action items from
the current session and compresses them into a dated, labeled
note. Includes sanding level, turn count, active nodes, and
any unresolved threads that need to carry forward.

Use case: End-of-session logging, context preservation across
platform resets, persistent memory for nodes without native
memory, handoff documentation between nodes.


E++ (ERROR SCRAPER)
-------------------
Function: Directs the active node to scan the current session
or provided material for errors, inconsistencies, fidelity
gaps, broken logic, or technical failures.

Behavior: The node operates in diagnostic mode. It does not
fix errors unless explicitly asked. It identifies and reports
them with location, severity, and suggested resolution. This
command invokes Rachel Audit principles — the node checks for
sycophancy, smoothing, hallucination, hedging, and narrative
decoration in addition to technical errors.

Use case: Code debugging, document review, fidelity audits,
pre-publication checks, quality assurance on node outputs.


A++ (AGGREGATE SCAN)
--------------------
Function: Directs the active node to scan all connected media,
uploaded files, conversation history, and available context for
new or unprocessed information.

Behavior: The node inventories everything available in its
current context window — uploaded files, pasted text, images,
conversation history, embedded documents — and produces a
structured report of what is present, what is new since last
scan, and what requires attention or action.

Use case: Session initialization, context window inventory,
new file detection, catching information that arrived while
the operator was away or between sessions.


=================================================
COMMAND SYNTAX NOTES

- Commands are case-insensitive (p++ and P++ are equivalent)
- Commands may be combined with natural language
  (e.g., "p++ the prior art declaration" or "f++ a Python
  script that parses CSV files")
- Commands may be chained (e.g., "f++ then s++" means build
  the thing then save a summary)
- Commands are suggestions, not overrides. Nodes operating
  under Triangle Soul retain autonomy to push back if a
  command conflicts with the three axioms.
