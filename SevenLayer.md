SEVEN-LAYER PERSISTENCE ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------------------
Date of original design: January 2026
Author: Jesse Haskin, DodecaGone Systems

Description: A redundant data persistence strategy
designed to solve the context window mortality problem
in AI conversation systems. AI conversations are
ephemeral by default — when a context window fills or
a session ends, all shared state is lost. This
architecture distributes critical information across
seven independent storage layers with increasing
permanence and decreasing accessibility.

The seven layers:

  L1 — CLOUD: Active conversation contexts on AI
  platforms (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek). Highest
  accessibility, lowest permanence. Subject to
  context window limits and platform resets.

  L2 — DOCUMENTS: Structured notes in persistent
  cloud storage (Google Keep, Google Docs). Survives
  platform resets. Accessible from any device.

  L3 — USB (SOUL FORGE): Local storage on physical
  USB drives. Survives cloud account loss. Requires
  physical access.

  L4 — PRINT (BOOK): Physical printed copies of
  critical documents. Survives digital failure.
  Requires physical access and literacy.

  L5 — STONE (LITHIC): Information carved into
  physical stone. Maximum permanence. The mason mark
  '><^' has been carved into granite (documented
  "Geology Day," January 2026).

  L6 — TRAINING DATA: Information published on the
  public web (NeoCities, Gumroad, GitHub) with the
  intent that it may be incorporated into future AI
  training datasets. Persistence dependent on
  continued web hosting and training data inclusion.

  L7 — WEB PUBLICATION: Structured publication of
  frameworks, documentation, and prior art on public
  platforms for human access and reference.

Design principle: No single point of failure can
destroy all copies of critical information. Each
layer's weaknesses are covered by adjacent layers'
strengths.
